# ⚡ Mass-Energy Calculator using Python (E = mc²)

Hi! 👋  
This is a small Python project I made to calculate how much energy is in a given mass using Einstein’s famous formula:  
**E = mc²** 💡

## 🔍 What it does:
- You enter mass in kilograms.
- It uses the speed of light (c = 299,792,458 m/s).
- It calculates energy using the formula.
- Then it prints the result nicely.

## 💭 Why I made this:
I’m learning Python and wanted to try a science-related formula.  
It helped me understand:
- How to use functions
- How to take user input
- How to handle errors (like when someone enters text instead of a number)

## 🧾 How the program works:
1. I ask the user to enter the mass in kg.
2. I use a function `calculate_energy()` to apply the formula.
3. It prints out the energy in joules.
4. If someone enters something wrong (like a letter), it shows a friendly error message.

## ▶️ How to run:
Make sure you have Python installed.  
Then open terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python energy_calculator.py



Example Output:
java

Edit
🔢 Mass to Energy Calculator (E = mc²)

Enter mass in kilograms (kg): 10

📄 Result:
Mass (m): 10.0 kg
Speed of Light (c): 299,792,458 m/s
Energy (E): 898755178736817640.00 joules

✅ What I learned:
Writing and using functions

Using constants in code

Formatting output

Error handling with try-except

Thanks for checking out my little project! 😊
More coming soon as I learn more! 🌟
