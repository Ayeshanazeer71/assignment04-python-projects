# Guess the Number Game

## About the Project
This is a simple **Guess the Number** game built using Python. The program generates a random number between **1 and 99**, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback:  
- "Too low!" if the guess is less than the number.  
- "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the number.  
Once the correct number is guessed, the game congratulates the player!

## Features
âœ… Random number generation (between 1 and 99)  
âœ… User-friendly input prompt  
âœ… Instant feedback on guesses  
âœ… Simple and efficient Python code  

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Copy the `guess_the_number.py` file to your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```sh
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and try to guess the number!

## Example Run
```
Guess a number between 1 and 99.
Your guess: 50
Too low!
Your guess: 75
Too high!
Your guess: 62
ðŸŽ‰ Correct! The number was 62.
```

## Why This Code is Great
- Uses **Python's Walrus Operator (`:=`)** for efficient input handling.
- Uses **f-strings** for cleaner and readable output.
- Minimal and beginner-friendly.
- No external dependenciesâ€”just pure Python!
